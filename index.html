        <h3>what are frontend and backend technologies?</h3>
        <img src="https://cache.arramton.com/arramton/17188911560460.7145860915953295.png" alt="image" height="190px">
        <p>
          To begin with ‚Äî remember that there is a strict division between frontend and backend for web page development.Backend technologies are related to the server side of the applications. In turn, frontend relates to the browser and user interfaces/interactions. While both sides contribute equally to the project‚Äôs success, this article will focus on the top frontend options for your project.</p>
          <h3>List of top frontend technologies</h3>
          <p>
            <h4>1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h4> 
    Let's begin with the basics: HTML is the foundation of frontend development and its importance is unlikely to diminish anytime soon. This technology enables you to create the structure or "markup" of your website, although it may not offer the most dynamic user interface, HTML elements provide you with basic tools to add buttons, forms, containers, and other features to web page.
    <h4>2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h4>

    Another core frontend technology, CSS allows you to add additional styling rules to the HTML structure you have created, ensuring that your web application is responsive and visually appealing with eye-catching animations that make it interactive and work seamlessly on any screen size or device.

    <h4>3. JavaScript</h4> 
    JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that has always been and will continue to be one of the most important frontend technologies for web and mobile applications, allowing developers to dynamically modify the contents of both mobile and desktop apps and implement various features such as shopping carts, complex animations, tax calculators, web browser games, and more.

    <h4>4. React</h4>
    React is a JavaScript library that offers new syntax while still being powered by JavaScript, making it faster and easier to create web applications due to its declarative and component-based nature.

    Originally designed by Facebook to enhance performance and maintenance for their internal use, it's now an open-source project with a vast community of the frontend developers, and is among the most popular JS tools.

    <h4>5. Angular</h4>

    Angular is a full-fledged JavaScript-based frontend framework supported by Google, and the modularity and component-based approach it provides have garnered a strong community among frontend developers worldwide.

    Its simplicity makes this framework perfect for single-page applications, and though some developers say that it's a bit harder to learn Angular than React, it's definitely worth it as there is a high demand in the market for experts in this technology, with Angular developers demand showing predicted growth of approximately 31% between 2016 and 2026.

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <img src="https://verpex.com/assets/uploads/images/blog/Basic-HTML-Codes-for-Websites.webp?v=1691760654" height="190vh" alt="html image">
        <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

          Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
          
          HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
          <p> HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the element, together with JavaScript.HistoryDevelopmentPhotograph of Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009
            In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[4] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.</p>
         
            The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[6] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[7][8] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.</p>
            <p>Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[14] In 2000, HTML became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.</p>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSUH-oIAvcVSDEN54K4XFbmUAynW9xva-dQ0g&s" height="190vh" alt="css image">
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3]
          <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
          
            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>
          
          The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
          
          The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[6]
          
          In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.</p>

        <h2>Java Script</h2>
        <img src="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/lib/images/javascript-illustration.png" height="190vh" alt="js image">
        <p>JavaScript (/Ààd í…ëÀêv…ôskr…™pt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]

          Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
          <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
          
          The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
          
          Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>

      <section5 id="nodejs">
        <h2>Node js</h2>
        <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/aq13lwl6616q/7cS8gBoWulxkWNWEm0FspJ/c7eb42dd82e27279307f8b9fc9b136fa/nodejs_cover_photo_smaller_size.png" height="190vh" alt="node image">
        <p>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

          <p>Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.</p>
          
          Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).[7]
          
          The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation,[8] and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.</p>

        <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[33]

          Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[34][35]
          <p>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[36] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.</p>
          
          Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.</p>

        <p>Java[a] is one of the islands in Indonesia. It is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and the Java Sea to the north. With a population of 153.8 million people, Java is the world's most populous island, home to approximately 54% of the Indonesian population.[2] Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta, is on Java's northwestern coast.</p>
          <p>Many of the best known events in Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon National Park, Borobudur Temple, Prambanan Temple, and Sangiran Early Man Site.
          </p>

        <img src="https://www.biz4group.com/images/why-choose-php-programming-language-for-web-development.jpg" height="190vh" alt="php image">
        <p>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.[8] It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995.[9][10] The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group.[11] PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal Home Page,[12][13] but it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
          <p>
            PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code‚Äîwhich may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data‚Äîwould form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist that can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications[15] and drone control.[16] PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.</p>
          
          <p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.[17]
          
            The PHP language has evolved without a written formal specification or standard, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard that other implementations aimed to follow.</p>
          
          
          W3Techs reports that as of 27 October 2024 (about two years since PHP 7 was discontinued and 11 months after the PHP 8.3 release), PHP 7 is still used by 50.0% of PHP websites, which is outdated and known to be insecure.[18][19] In addition, the even more outdated (discontinued for 5+ years) and insecure PHP 5 is used by 13.2% and the no longer supported PHP 8.0 is also very popular, so the majority of PHP websites do not use supported versions.</p>

        <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[5][6] that aims to make building user interfaces based on components more "seamless".[5] It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.[7][8][9]

          React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js and Remix[a]. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.
          <p>A key advantage of React is that it only re-renders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements.React code is made of entities called components.[14]:‚Ää10‚Äì12‚Ää These components are modular and reusable.[14]:‚Ää70‚Ää React applications typically consist of many layers of components. The components are rendered to a root element in the DOM using the React DOM library. When rendering a component, values are passed between components through props (short for "properties"). Values internal to a component are called its state.</p>

          The two primary ways of declaring components in React are through function components and class components.</p>

        <p>MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB utilizes JSON-like documents with optional schemas. Released in February 2009 by 10gen (now MongoDB Inc.), it supports features like sharding, replication, and ACID transactions (from version 4.0). MongoDB Atlas, its managed cloud service, operates on AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. Current versions are licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL). MongoDB is a member of the MACH Alliance.
          <p>The American software company 10gen began developing MongoDB in 2007 as a component of a planned platform-as-a-service product. In 2009, the company shifted to an open-source development model and began offering commercial support and other services. In 2013, 10gen changed its name to MongoDB Inc.</p>
<p>On October 20, 2017, MongoDB became a publicly traded company, listed on NASDAQ as MDB with an IPO price of $24 per share.[6]

  On November 8, 2018, with the stable release 4.0.4, the software's license changed from AGPL 3.0 to SSPL.[7][8]
  
  On October 30, 2019, MongoDB teamed with Alibaba Cloud to offer Alibaba Cloud customers a MongoDB-as-a-service solution. Customers can use the managed offering from Alibaba's global data centers.</p>
